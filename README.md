## About
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate **web developer** who enjoys crafting modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my work, highlighting the projects I've built and the skills I've developed along the way.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **MiniMon** – a simple JavaScript project, that displays information about Pokémon.
- **DojoDB** – a React-based single-page application (SPA), that allows users to browse a curated list of movies, save favourites movies, learn more about directors and actors from the martial arts genre.
- **Eventify** – a serverless, Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with React, that allows users to find events based in specific cities.

Each project reflects my expertise in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and other web technologies. You can explore the full details of my work on the **[Projects](https://jasdevelops.github.io/myportfolio/projects.html)** page.
